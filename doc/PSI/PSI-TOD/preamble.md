The Pooling and Sharing Interfaces Definition (PSID) project is based on the Open Digital Framework of the TM Forum alliance[^1].
It defines processes and business entities that are commonly used by telecommunication providers to achieve the best possible compatibility between them towards rapidly transforming their business operations into multipartner digital services.
Although most of the work is built around terrestrial communication services, satellite providers are interested to adapt it, too.
PSID follows the same domain structure, including but not necessarily restricted to:

* Common
* Customer
* Product
* Service
* Resource

The actual specification of the standardized APIs is based on the Open APIs of TM Forum, which are closely related to all other TM Forum frameworks.
They are entity-centric and manipulate resources that are found in the Information Framework (SID) and they play part in a number of business processes that are defined in the Business Process Framework (also known as eTOM).

The Business Process Framework (eTOM) categorizes business activities in a structured manner starting from high-level core processes that are further decomposed by lower-level activities.
There is a wide range of business processes which are adopted in the different domains, but this document outlines only relevant ones for the PSID project, excluding all that are not required.

One-to-one mapping between the business processes of the eTOM and the API specification is rather challenging.
Therefore, the descriptions of tasks and operations for the PSID are tailored in such a way as to match the interactions between entities providing/consuming satellite communication services via standardised interfaces, while the related process identifiers from the eTOM are referenced where applicable.

The criteria used to build the list of tasks and operations are:

* The candidate requirements, which define the functionalities that should be supported by the interfaces.
* The identified needs of the consortium partners via direct communication with them.
