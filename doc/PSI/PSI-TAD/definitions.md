The table below lists all definitions that are being used in the context of PSID, i.e. in communication, design/documents and implementation.

| Term | Definition | Explanation / Understanding |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alarm | An *Alarm* is a specific type of notification concerning detected faults or abnormal conditions. | Alarms are generated by a Service provider in case thresholds specified in a service level specifications are violated. |
| API Gateway               | The *API Gateway* is the only access point for all clients and hides the backend from the caller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Modern applications distribute the work and responsibility among a collection of backend services. This complexity of the backend is of no relevance for the caller and is hidden behind the *API Gateway*. In addition, the *API Gateway* takes care of common tasks like authentication, load balancing, security measures, rate limiting, etc. |
| Area Of Operation         | *Areas Of Operation* (AOOs) are predefined geographical areas in and for which a [PSS](#pss) is willing to provide [services](#service) to its [customers](#customer).                                                                                                                                                                                               | An AOO is defined by the [system governance](#system-governance) who should keep track of AOOs where no [service](#service) is available. Note that this is very different from a [mission zone](#mission-zone), which is defined by a [customer](#customer) and can cover areas where the [PSS](#pss) cannot offer any [service](#service).      |
| Attachment                | An *attachment* represents an actual binary content along with the mime type, size, or url to a file storage where the actual attachment can be accessed.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | An *attachment* belongs to a [document](#document).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Catalog                   | A subset of the [portfolio](#portfolio) containing only currently offered entities. The *catalog* thus contains [product specifications](#product-specification), [service specifications](#service-specification), and [resource specifications](#resource-specification), as well as [product offerings](#product-offering).                                       | Required for on-demand and offered [resources](#resource).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Contention                | A *contention* situation arises, if the sum of the capacity (e.g., the CIRs) allocated for all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) actually exceeds the total available capacity, i.e., when the [overbooking](#overbooking) actually manifests itself.                                                          | *Contention* always needs to be mitigated, e.g., by processes implemented by the [PSS](#pss) based on priority and/or pre-emption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Customer                  | A [customer](#customer) utilizes a [PSS](#pss) to model/specify, find and acquire [services](#service) and [resources](#resource), usually becoming customers of [providers](#provider).                                                                                                                                                                             | A role of a business party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dedicated Service         | A *dedicated service* is a special kind of [service](#service) that can either have no PIR assigned or have the PIR equal to the CIR. If a [resource](#resource) is used to implement multiple instances of a service or different services, each [customer](#customer) has a dedicated chunk of the underlying resource that is never shared with another customer. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Document                  | A *document* describes the metadata for associated [attachment(s)](#attachment). It contains characteristics such as name, related parties, version, lifecycle status, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                          | A *document* contains a list of one or more [attachments](#attchment).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Inventory                 | A set of concrete [products](#product), [services](#service), and [resources](#resource).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Required to commit [items](#item), but may also be dynamically managed as part of the [order process](#order-process) to enable monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Order Process             | The *order process* describes the full lifecycle of an [order](#order), beginning with an [order](#order) request by the [customer](#customer) and the termination of the [order](#order) by deletion through the [customer](#customer) or [provider](#provider) or by the end of the booked period.                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Overbooking               | *Overbooking* refers to the scenario of more instances of an [item](#item) being offered by a provider than are actually in stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | For example, If the sum of the CIRs of all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) will exceed the total available capacity at some point in the future, the services are subject to overbooking.                                                                                                 |
| Oversubscription          | [Shared services](#shared-service) are subject to oversubscription if the sum of the PIRs of all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) exceeds the total available capacity, but the sum of the CIRs does not.                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Partial Match             | An inquiry initiated by a customer leads to the identified product offerings. An offering is called a partial match if it does not fully satisfy the inquired product characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                               | For example, the customer inquires about a 50 Mbps download rate for internet access, but the provider can only offer a maximum of 40 Mbps. A PSS can enable the customer to specify the allowed deviation for each product characteristic in the customer inquiry.                                                                               |
| Business Party            | An organisation or individual taking part of a business interaction, e.g., as a [customer](#customer) or [provider](#provider).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A party can have different roles in different interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Performance Monitoring Job | *Performance monitoring jobs* contain the configuration of performance objectives, the related subject (service or other type of entity), measurement intervals and schedules to enable performance monitoring. Examples of performance objectives encompass various metrics such as frame/packet delay, frame/packet loss ratio, inter-frame/packet delay variation, and more. These objectives serve as measurable criteria for assessing the performance characteristics of a service. | The PSS implementation supports a single type of jobs. On-demand performance monitoring jobs are initiated for a limited time, typically a single run or non-continuous run, to carry out the performance measurement tests and support troubleshooting during service assurance. |
| Performance Monitoring Report | *Performance monitoring reports* are output of the performance monitoring job processing or generated on request. They contain performance data produced as a result of the provisioning of a service with an attached SLS. *Performance monitoring reports* deliver comprehensive performance collections to the requesting party. |  |
