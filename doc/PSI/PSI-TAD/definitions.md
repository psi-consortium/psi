The table below lists all definitions that are being used in the context of PSID, i.e. in communication, design/documents and implementation.

| Term | Definition | Explanation / Understanding |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| <span id="api-gateway"> </span>API Gateway | The *API Gateway* is the only access point for all clients and hides the backend from the caller. | Modern applications distribute the work and responsibility among a collection of backend services. This complexity of the backend is of no relevance for the caller and is hidden behind the *API Gateway*. In addition, the *API Gateway* takes care of common tasks like authentication, load balancing, security measures, rate limiting, etc. |
| <span id="area-of-operation"> </span>Area Of Operation | *Areas Of Operation* (AOOs) are predefined geographical areas in and for which a [PSS](#pss) is willing to provide [services](#service) to its [customers](#customer). | An AOO is defined by the [system governance](#system-governance) who should keep track of AOOs where no [service](#service) is available. Note that this is very different from a [mission zone](#mission-zone), which is defined by a [customer](#customer) and can cover areas where the [PSS](#pss) cannot offer any [service](#service). |
| <span id="attachment"> </span>Attachment | An *attachment* represents an actual binary content along with the mime type, size, or url to a file storage where the actual attachment can be accessed. | An *attachment* belongs to a [document](#document). |
| <span id="catalog"> </span>Catalog | A subset of the [portfolio](#portfolio) containing only currently offered entities. The *catalog* thus contains [product specifications](#product-specification), [service specifications](#service-specification), and [resource specifications](#resource-specification), as well as [product offerings](#product-offering). | Required for on-demand and offered [resources](#resource). |
| <span id="contention"> </span>Contention | A *contention* situation arises, if the sum of the capacity (e.g., the CIRs) allocated for all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) actually exceeds the total available capacity, i.e., when the [overbooking](#overbooking) actually manifests itself. | *Contention* always needs to be mitigated, e.g., by processes implemented by the [PSS](#pss) based on priority and/or pre-emption. |
| <span id="customer"> </span>Customer | A [customer](#customer) utilizes a [PSS](#pss) to model/specify, find and acquire [services](#service) and [resources](#resource), usually becoming customers of [providers](#provider). | A role of a business party. |
| <span id="dedicated-service"> </span>Dedicated Service | A *dedicated service* is a special kind of [service](#service) that can either have no PIR assigned or have the PIR equal to the CIR. If a [resource](#resource) is used to implement multiple instances of a service or different services, each [customer](#customer) has a dedicated chunk of the underlying resource that is never shared with another customer. | |
| <span id="document"> </span>Document | A *document* describes the metadata for associated [attachment(s)](#attachment). It contains characteristics such as name, related parties, version, lifecycle status, etc. | A *document* contains a list of one or more [attachments](#attchment). |
| <span id="inventory"> </span>Inventory | A set of concrete [products](#product), [services](#service), and [resources](#resource). | Required to commit [items](#item), but may also be dynamically managed as part of the [order process](#order-process) to enable monitoring. |
| <span id="item"> </span>Item | Sometimes used collectively for [resource](#resource), [service](#service), and [product](#product). | |
| <span id="key-performance-indicator"> </span>Key Performance Indicator | *Key Performance Indicators* (KPI) are technical and organizational parameters and requirements on [services](#service). KPIs are features/criteria guaranteed (incl. e.g. boundary conditions) by the [provider](#provider) to a [customer](#customer). | They can also exist at [PSS](#pss) level, e.g., coverage of different areas, frequency bands available, delay between request and offer, ratio of successful request served etc. |
| <span id="mission"> </span>Mission | A *mission* is a set of customer-defined [products](#product) within the same operational context and scope. | |
| <span id="mission-zone"> </span>Mission Zone | A *mission zone* is a geographical area that a [mission](#mission) takes place in. | A [mission](#mission) has one or more mission zones. [Services](#service) terminate in one or more mission zones. |
| <span id="operation"> </span>Operation | An *operation* is a low-level activity towards concluding a certain [task](#task). It is the third level of hierarchy of the TOD. | |
| <span id="order"> </span>Order | An *order* is created when a [customer](#customer) requests to book a [product](#product). | |
| <span id="order-process"> </span>Order Process | The *order process* describes the full lifecycle of an [order](#order), beginning with an [order](#order) request by the [customer](#customer) and the termination of the [order](#order) by deletion through the [customer](#customer) or [provider](#provider) or by the end of the booked period. | |
| <span id="overbooking"> </span>Overbooking | *Overbooking* refers to the scenario of more instances of a [items](#item) being offered by a provider than are actually in stock. | For example, If the sum of the CIRs of all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) will exceed the total available capacity at some point in the future, the services are subject to overbooking. |
| <span id="oversubscription"> </span>Oversubscription | [Shared services](#shared-service) are subject to oversubscription if the sum of the PIRs of all [services](#service) sharing the capacity of the same underlying [resources](#resource) exceeds the total available capacity, but the sum of the CIRs does not. | |
| <span id="partial-match"> </span>Partial Match | An inquiry initiated by a customer leads to the identified product offerings. An offering is called a partial match if it does not fully satisfy the inquired product characteristics. | For example, the customer inquires about a 50 Mbps download rate for internet access, but the provider can only offer a maximum of 40 Mbps. A PSS can enable the customer to specify the allowed deviation for each product characteristic in the customer inquiry. |
| <span id="party"> </span>Business Party | An organisation or individual taking part of a business interaction, e.g., as a [customer](#customer) or [provider](#provider). | A party can have different roles in different interactions. |

| <span id="product"> </span>Product | A *product* bundles one or more [service](#service) or [resource](#resource) to be offered to [customers](#customer). | |
| <span id="product-offering"> </span>Product Offering | A *product offering* is a concrete offer of a [product specification](#product-specification) to a [customer](#customer). This can be through a catalog or directly to a user (as the result of ITT or RFQ).Â  It also contains other business-related information such as SLSs and pricing information. | |
| <span id="product-specification"> </span>Product Specification | A *product specification* describes general characteristics a [product](#product) can have based on its [resource type](#resource-type). | The *product specification* allows a [provider](#provider) to specify the parameters they can offer. |
| <span id="provider"> </span>Provider | *Providers* offer their [products](#product) to [customers](#customer) of a [PSS](#pss). | A role of a business party. |
| <span id="pss"> </span>PSS | An expert system and service broker for SatCom-centric [service](#service). | The solution aggregates both the supply and demand of SatCom services, and provides business processes facilitating the management of the services and resources. |
| <span id="resource"> </span>Resource | A communication(-associated) resource like RF bandwidth, terminal hardware etc. A resource implements an underlying [resource specification](#resource-specification) with a specific [resource type](#resource-type). | Resources are inputs to a [PSS](#pss) and are brought into by [providers](#provider). A [PSS](#pss) constructs/markets/brokers [products](#product) from resources. |
| <span id="resource-precedence"> </span>Resource Precedence | The hierarchy / precedence of [resource](#resource) that a [PSS](#pss) might offer/use. | [Customers](#user)' private resources > committed resources > offered resources > non-offered resources (fitting [resource](#resource) known, but no offers) => query [providers](#provider) > non-existent resources (no fitting [resource](#resource) known => query [providers](#provider)) |
| <span id="resource-specification"> </span>Resource Specification | A *resource specification* describe general characteristics a resource can have based on its [resource type](#resource-type). | The *resource specification* allows a [provider](#provider) to specify the parameters they can offer. |
| <span id="resource-type"> </span>Resource Type | A *resource type* is an abstraction of a [resource](#resource) based on type (e.g. "terminal", "router", "constellation", ...), which describes all necessary parameters for [resource specifications](#resource-specification) and [resources](#resource) of that type. | The *resource type* is defined as a JSON schema an referred to by the parameter *\@type*. |
| <span id="service"> </span>Service | A communication service that is specified by and brokered/given to [customers](#cstomer) of a [PSS](#pss). A service implements an underlying [service specification](#service-specification) with a specific [service type](#service-type). | *Services* are inputs to a [PSS](#pss) and are brought into by [providers](#provider). A [PSS](#pss) constructs/markets/brokers [products](#product) from services. |
| <span id="service-specification"> </span>Service Specification | A *resource specification* describe general characteristics a resource can have based on its [service type](#service-type). | The *service specification* allows a [provider](#provider) to specify the parameters they can offer. |

| <span id="system-governance"> </span>System Governance | The *system governance* is the governing body of a [PSS](#pss). | A PSS's governance is tasked with e.g. the management of [service](#service) and the adjustment of workflows and configuration parameters to tailor a PSS to the operational rules, needs and realities. |
| <span id="task"> </span>Task | A *task* represents a business process which consists of a group of low-level operations that need to be performed to conclude it. It is the second level of hierarchy of the TOD. | An example task is *Party Management*. It involves low-level operations such as *Create Party Profile* or *Delete Party Profile*. |
| <span id="task-category"> </span>Task Category | A *category* provides logical grouping of tasks that belong to a same high-level business process. It is the first level of hierarchy of the TOD. | An example category is 'Product Publishing'. |
