## Known Limitations

1. The Service Quality Management is rather basic.
   There is an ongoing effort to align this set of APIs with the results of a TM Forum Catalyst project.
   More information will follow in one of the next releases.
1. The Mission Management Service is at an early state.
   However, the available API implements basic mission management services, import and export.
   A full set of APIs to implement such a service are subject to an upcoming release.
   Refer also the [PSI-GID] to learn about the available API use cases.
