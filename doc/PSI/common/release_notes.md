## What's New

* **PSI001 - Customer Inquiry Management API**:
  The Customer Inquiry Management API is wrapping the Catalog Management APIs to provide results based on an inquiry send by the customer.
  The Customer Inquiry Management API takes care of the handling of inquiries sent by a customer and responded by a PSS or provider.
  
  The PSS may provide different ways for the customer to create an inquiry, depending on the expertise of the user.
  These can range from just selecting from templates with commonly used product types, optionally customizing the characteristics or even the manual definition of the communication needs.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `customerInquiry`: Customer Inquiry API

* **PSI620 - Product Catalog Management API**:
  Based on TMF620 - Product Catalog Management API (Version 4.1.0).

  The Product Catalog Management API provides a standardized solution for rapidly adding partnersâ€™ products to an existing Catalog. It brings the capability for Service Providers to directly feed partners systems with the technical description of the products they propose to them.

  The Product Catalog Management API provides the operation for the maintenance of product specifications available in the PSS, brought in by providers.
  A provider wants to utilize a PSS to offer their products to the users of the PSS.
  The products implement a product specification (describing general characteristics of the product), and they bundle one or more services and/or on-site resources.
  Therefore, a provider needs to be able to register(create) product specifications to the PSS, modify, remove or view them.
  Another PSS needs to be able to view the product specifications as well.

  The TM Forum API is extended by Product Template REST API.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `/productOffering`: Product Offering API
  * `/productSpecification`: Product Specification API
  * `/productTemplate`: Product Template API

* **PSI620 - Trouble Ticket Management API**:
  Based on TMF621 - Trouble Ticket Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  The Trouble Ticket API provides a standardized client interface to Trouble Ticket Management Systems for creating, tracking and managing trouble tickets as a result of an issue or problem identified by a customer or another system.
  Examples of Trouble Ticket API originators (clients) include CRM applications, network management or fault management systems, or other Trouble Ticket management systems (e.g. B2B).

  The Trouble Ticket API provides the operation for tracking incident reports, complaints and other requests of customers and providers.
  They can be processed either by a PSS helpdesk operator if they concern the functionality of the PSS itself, or by the provider if they affect a SATCOM service.
  Most likely, the actual implementation is outsourced to an existing ticket system or the CRM.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `/troubleTicket`: Trouble Ticket API

* **PSI622 - Product Ordering Management API**:
  Based on TMF622 - Product Ordering Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  The Product Ordering API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a product order with all the necessary order parameters.
  The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Order Negotiation systems consistently.
  A product order is created based on a product offer that is defined in a catalog.
  The product offer identifies the product or set of products that are available to a customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing, product options and market.
  This API provides a task based resource to request order cancellation.

  The product order references the product offer and identifies any specific requests made by the customer.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `productOrder`: Product Order API

* **PSI632 - Party Management API**:
  Based on TMF632 - Party Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  The party API provides standardized mechanism for party management such as creation, update, retrieval, deletion and notification of events.
  A Party can be an individual or an organization that has any kind of relation with the enterprise.
  A Party is created to record individual or organization information before the assignment of any role.
  For example, within the context of a split billing mechanism, Party API allows creation of the individual or organization that will play the role of 3rd payer for a given offer and, then, allows consultation or update of their information.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `individual`: Individual API
  * `organization`: Organization API

* **PSI633 - Service Catalog Management API**:
  Based on TMF633 - Service Catalog Management API (Version 4.0.0).

* **PSI657 - Service Quality Management API**
  Based on TMF657 Service Quality Management API (Version 4.0.0).
  
  The Service Quality Management API provides standardized mechanism for managing service level objectives (SLO) and service level specifications (SLS), which in turn are used to define service level agreements (SLAs) and declare monitoring of services and resources on provider side.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `serviceLevelObjective`: Service Level Objective API
  * `serviceLevelSpecification`: Service Level Specification API

* **PSI667 - Document Management API**:
  Based on TMF667 Document Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  The Document Management API provides the operations to synchronize documents and document versions across systems, i.e., between providers, customers and PSS.
  It also provides operations for uploading documents as well as for viewing of documents online.
  For example, a product offering of a provider is accompanied by a Service Level Agreement that should be shared with the customer via REST API, or when an order is concluded, an interface is required for sending the invoice.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `document`: Document Management API
  * `attachment`: Attachment Management API

* **PSI678 - Customer Bill Management API**:
  Based on TMF678 - Customer Bill Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  It takes care of bills (invoices) produced for a customer for placed orders in the PSS.
  A customer bill or invoice is a document produced at the end of a regular back office process at the provider side which runs according to a bill cycle definition.
  The customer bill contains information about the total amount due to be paid by a customer for the ordered product(s) during the billing period, the due date for the payment, and other information like the order and attachment references.

  It also allows the notification of events related to them.

  The Stock Management API provides the operations to wrap the inventories to allow a PSS (on behalf of a customer) to check the availability of a providerâ€™s product.
  There are more operations that are performed internally on the provider side, which are not covered by the PSI but may be implemented consistently with TM Forum.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `checkProductStock`: Stock Check API

* **PSI688 - Event Management API**:

  Based on TMF688 - Event Management API (Version 4.0.0).

  The Event Management API provides a standardized client interface to the enterprise event management system for creating, managing and receiving service related events to (indicatively) drive automation workflows, notify other service providers for service outages and SLA violations, trigger Trouble Ticket creation, and enable more complex orchestration scenarios between management systems.
  The Event Management API can also be used to convey business level Events in support of other processes.

  Some processes between a PSS and a provider (or PSS and PSS), such as customer inquiries and orders, can take longer time to complete.
  For example, when a customer inquiry is created, the provider may require significant time to process and respond with an adequate product offering.
  Or, when a product order is placed by a customer, it can take hours to days for its state to change, e.g. from *inProgress* to *completed*.

  Inside a PSS (or a sophisticated provider system) the anticipated approach to propagate such state changes are message queues.
  A direct connection between these, although possible, would result in a strong coupling of the systems and major implications by the interface definition on the internal implementations.
  In order to avoid this, the Event Management defines how to exchange the information using REST.
  
  Note that this does not enforce the use of message queues.
  All named operations and endpoints can also be implemented in a monolithic application.

  Included REST APIs:
  * `hub`: Event Hub API
  * `listener`: Event Listener API

## Known Limitations

1. Standardized JSON Schemas for resources, services, and products (including space assets and user terminals) are not available in the first release of PSI due do contractual obligations.
   They will be made available in the next release.
2. The Service Quality Management is rather basic.
   There is an ongoing effort to align this set of APIs with the results of a TM Forum Catalyst project.
   More information will follow in one of the next releases.
3. The Inquiry Management API implies the existence of a Mission Management Service.
   However, the available API implements only the outgoing interface.
   A full set of APIs to implement such a service are subject to an upcoming release.
