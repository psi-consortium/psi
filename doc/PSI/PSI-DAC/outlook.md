# Automation of document generation - Conclusion

[[_TOC_]]

=end

We have shown how PSI uses Documentation as Code within its repository.
Furthermore, we have elaborated how requirements are tracked and traced in an automated way as well.
In addition, API schema files being developed within PSI are transformed to match TM Forum's OAS file definitions in an automated way.
Lastly, we have assessed how LLMs, in Mistral flavor, can be used to automatically generate TM Forum's Conformance and Userguide documents based on the provided OAS file.

Thus, the integration of documentation as code, automated requirements tracing, and document generation via LLM within a pipeline can potentially engender a multitude of advantages that serve to streamline and enhance the software development process.
Primarily, the quality of documentation is significantly enhanced.
DaC fosters high-quality, consistent documentation that remains in alignment with the codebase, thereby reducing the manual effort required from developers and ensuring that documentation is perpetually current and accurate.
Furthermore, the real-time nature of the pipeline is a significant advantage.
The pipeline ensures that documentation is updated in real-time with every code change, which is particularly beneficial in fast-paced development environments, meaning that the documentation is always up-to-date and reflects the current state of the codebase.
Another salient benefit is traceability.
By automating the linkage of code changes to specific requirements, the pipeline ensures that every piece of code can be traced back to its origin.
This is crucial for compliance, auditing and maintaining software quality, as it provides a clear and trackable history of changes.
Additionally, the reduced human error resulting from automating documentation and requirements tracing is a substantial benefit, leading to more accurate and reliable documentation and traceability matrices, and enhancing the overall quality and reliability.
With documentation and requirements tracing integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, developers can focus on writing code while the pipeline handles the rest.
This reduction in overhead, due to the elimination of manual documentation and traceability tasks, enables a more efficient and productive workflow.

Assuming an LLM is rendered capable of handling the auto-generation of documents as suggested in the previous chapter, a significant benefit from such a workflow can be scalability.
As projects grow, the LLM can continue to generate and maintain documentation without additional manual effort, ensuring that the documentation process scales with the codebase.
This makes it suitable for projects of any size.

In summary, introducing a pipeline including DaC, automated requirements tracing and LLMs for generating mandatory documents for ODA publication enhances the overall quality and reliability of the software development process.
On top, the inclusion of OAS automated transformation allows to easily publish TM Forum compliant APIs.
Thus, this pipeline offers a comprehensive solution that improves documentation quality, enhances traceability, streamlines the development process, scales with the project, provides real-time updates, and reduces human error.
This approach is a potent one, with the potential to markedly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the software development process.
