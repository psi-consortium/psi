### Auto-generating Conformance documentation

[[_TOC_]]

=end

Mistral was asked first to analyze the provided PDF Conformance documents for their structure and similarities:

```
Prompt: "Please show me all passages of the uploaded pdf files that are the same, either in context or verbatim."
```

As result, Mistral correctly pointed out the *Copyright Notice and Permissions* section to be identical.
The *Table of Contents* was denoted as similar, but not equal, while the *Introduction* section was analyzed to be content wise similar:

```
Each document has an "Introduction - API description" section that describes the purpose and functionality of the API covered by the document. While the specific details differ, the structure and intent of this section are consistent.
```
The same observation was made for *Resource Model Conformance*, *API Operations Conformance*, *API GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE Operation Conformance*, *Acknowledgements and Release History* and *Mandatory Attributes Tables*:

```
The sections titled "Resource Model Conformance" and "General Notes on Resource Attribute Conformance" are structured similarly across the documents. They explain the mandatory resources and attributes for the respective APIs.
Each document includes a section on "API Operations Conformance," which lists the mandatory operations for the API resources. The structure and format of these tables are consistent across the documents.
The documents detail the conformance for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations, including status codes and mandatory attributes. The format and approach to describing these operations are similar.
The "Acknowledgements" and "Release History" sections are structured similarly, although the specific content may vary.
The tables listing mandatory attributes for different resources (e.g., TroubleTicket, Individual, Organization, ProductOffering) are formatted similarly, with columns for the attribute name and conformance rules.
These commonalities indicate a standardized approach to documenting API conformance profiles across different specifications within the TM Forum.
```

As a result from this analysis, the *Copyright Notice and Permissions* could be included as text building block in any conformance document.

Secondly, Mistral was asked to generate an introduction to the API TMF653, based on the OAS schema:

```
Prompt: "Following the style in the given pdf files, formulate an introduction to the API given in the uploaded json."
```

Mistral (A) was able to write a very precise introduction, outlining the API features and handlings, while the benchmark introduction was much shorter and did not provide any details (B):

```
(A) The following document is the specification of the REST API for Service Test Management. This API provides a structured approach to managing the testing of services, allowing for the definition, execution, and monitoring of test cases and test suites. The API supports operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete test-related entities, enabling comprehensive test management capabilities.
The Service Test Management API is designed to facilitate the integration of testing processes within service-oriented architectures, ensuring that services meet quality and performance standards. It includes resources and operations to handle test plans, test cases, test results, and related metadata, supporting automated and manual testing workflows.
This API adheres to the principles of RESTful design, utilizing standard HTTP methods and providing a clear and consistent interface for interacting with test management data. The specifications outlined in this document detail the mandatory resources, attributes, and operations necessary for conformance, ensuring interoperability and ease of integration with other systems and services.

(B) The following document is the conformance specification of the REST API for Any management.
```
Given this result, it can be concluded that Mistral is capable of writing a very good introduction based on the provided OAS schema file.

Next, Mistral was tasked to generate chapter *Resource Model Conformance*.
The prompt had to be defined very precisely, as Mistral tended to include too many resource definitions compared to the benchmark document:

```
Prompt: "Based on the provided json file, write a section for "Resouce Model Conformance" following the styles in the pdf files. Include only the resources directly related to the core functionality of the API as mandatory."
```

The text generated by Mistral was a 100% match with the benchmark text, proving that Mistral could be applied to generate this section of the document as well.

The next chapters - *API Operations Conformance*, *API GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE Operation Conformance*, *Acknowledgements and Release History* and *Mandatory Attributes Tables*, were prompted likewise.
However, Mistral was not able to generate document sections that matched the benchmark document save for subsection *Notification Model Conformance* with a 100% match.
We found that several attributes were constantly missing, or even wrong assessments.
Thus, PATCH and DELETE, marked as non-mandatory operations in the benchmark pdf, were listed by Mistral as mandatory and added.
Remarkably though, if provided with enough detail, Mistral was able to generate a 100% match for subchapter *API GET operation conformance* using the prompt

```
Prompt: Following the schema presented in the pdf files, write the "API GET operation conformance" based on the provided json file.
```
Thus, Mistral seems to be able to generate those sections if the prompts are precise enough.

#### Overall assessment

Mistral exceedes in generating the introduction and the *Resource Model Conformance* chapter with fairly easy prompts.
Also, Mistral is able to generate subchapters if the prompts are precise and written with knowledge about the API, as embedded in the OAS schema file.
However, Mistral is not capable of generating documentation for the other chapters; information was found to be missing or, worse, to be wrong.
