### Auto-generating Userguide documentation

[[_TOC_]]

=end

Again, Mistral was asked first to analyze the provided pdf documents for their structure and similarities:

```
Prompt: "Please show me all passages of the three uploaded pdf files that are the same, either in context or verbatim."
```

Mistral identified all chapters to be identical from context and also peculiarities of each chapter, e.g.

```
API Operations:
All documents describe similar API operations such as retrieving, listing, creating, updating, and deleting entities. The operations follow a standard RESTful approach with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods.
The descriptions of these operations are similar in terms of how they are executed and what they achieve.
```

As common sections, Mistral identified chapters *Notice*, *Table of Contents* and *Acknowledgements* to be

```
similar in format and content across all documents, as they are standard sections in technical specifications.
```

Thus, the structure of the Userguide documents was described and well analysed from content perspective.
Mistral was able to identify the intention of each chapter.

Next, Mistral was asked to write the *Introduction* for the Service Test Management Userguide:

```
Prompt: Write the section "Introduction" based on the provides json file and following the style identified in the provided pdf files.
```

Mistral wrote an introduction that strongly differed from the benchmark document.
Thus, the request was refined using the benchmark introduction as input as well to understand the difference better:

```
Prompt: Compare your answer to "The following document is the specification of the REST API for Service Test Management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving Service Test. The Service Test API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a service  test with all the necessary test parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Service Management systems in a consistent manner. A service test is a procedure intended to check the quality, performance, or reliability of a service. Service Test Management API manages service test resource and  service specification test resource: 
• A service test specification describes the service test in terms of parameters to be
configured and measures to be taken.
• A service exists for a controlled test invocation on a service. The service test is executed
according to a schedule. and contains service test configuration parameters that are to
be applied at execution time, and service test measures that result."
```

Mistral outlined the strenghts and weeknesses of its own produced text and the benchmark text and suggested a combined introduction text.

```
My Proposed Introduction:
Strengths:
Clearly states the purpose of the API: managing and executing service tests.
Lists the main resources (ServiceTest and ServiceTestSpecification) and operations (Retrieve, Partial Update, Create, Delete, Notification Management).
Provides a structured overview, similar to the style in the provided PDF files.
Weaknesses:
Does not explicitly mention interaction with CRM/Service Management systems.
Lacks specific details about the nature of a service test (e.g., checking quality, performance, or reliability).
Does not elaborate on the execution of service tests according to a schedule.

Provided Introduction:
Strengths:
Provides a detailed explanation of what a service test is and its purpose.
Mentions interaction with CRM/Service Management systems, which gives context to the API's usage.
Describes the resources (service test and service test specification) in more detail, including execution parameters and measures.
Explains the scheduling aspect of service tests.
Weaknesses:
The structure is less concise and could benefit from clearer sectioning for readability.
Does not explicitly list all operations (e.g., Partial Update, Notification Management) as my version does.

Combined and Improved Version:
Introduction - API description
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Service Test Management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. The Service Test Management API aims to provide a standardized mechanism for managing and executing service tests, ensuring quality, performance, and reliability assessments of provisioned services.

Resources
ServiceTest: Represents a controlled test invocation on a service, executed according to a schedule. It includes configuration parameters applied at execution time and measures resulting from the test.
ServiceTestSpecification: Describes the service test in terms of parameters to be configured and measures to be taken.
Operations
The Service Test Management API performs the following operations on the resources:

Retrieve: Allows retrieval of an entity or a collection of entities based on specified filter criteria.
Partial Update: Enables updating parts of an entity, including updating rules.
Create: Facilitates the creation of an entity, including default values and creation rules.
Delete: Allows deletion of an entity for administrative purposes.
Notification Management: Manages notifications of events related to service tests.
This API interacts with CRM/Service Management systems in a consistent manner, providing a comprehensive solution for service test management.
```

These observations suggest that Mistral bases the text solely on the information provided in the json schema file.
As this file did not include any meta information on, e.g., the nature of the service test, Mistral could not derive the information as given in the benchmark document.
Putatively, Mistral is able to write an introduction similar to the one given in the benchmark document if these meta informations are given in the provided json schema file.

Subsequently, Mistral was asked to write chapters *Managed Entity and Task Resource Models*, *Notification Resource Models* and *API Operations* with prompts like

```
Prompt: Based on the information provided in the json file, write chapter "API Operations" for resources directly related to the core functionality of the API.
```

However, Mistral was not able to write those chapters.

Mistral was further asked to write the chapter *Sample Use cases* based on the provided json schema file:

```
Prompt: Based on the style identified in the pdfs and the content on the provided json file, write chapter "Sample Use cases" giving at least one use case per resource diretly related to the core functionality of the API in the json file.
```

Mistral identified use cases with sufficient granularity of detail, e.g.

```
Use Case 1: Managing a Service
Scenario
A service provider wants to create, update, and manage a new service offering within their system. The service should include details such as name, description, status, and associated tags. The provider also wants to ensure that the service can be retrieved and updated efficiently.

Steps
Create a Service: Use the POST /services operation to create a new service with details such as name, description, status, and tags.
Retrieve a Service: Use the GET /services/{serviceId} operation to retrieve the details of the newly created service.
Update a Service: Use the PATCH /services/{serviceId} operation to update specific attributes of the service, such as changing its status or description.
Delete a Service: Use the DELETE /services/{serviceId} operation to delete the service if it is no longer needed.
Expected Outcome
The service provider successfully manages the lifecycle of the service, from creation to potential deletion, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately maintained and accessible.
```

The suggestions provided by Mistral are very good for demonstrating the API's capabilities.
However, the resources identified do not match the benchmark document.
As such, the POST /services resource is not presented in the benchmark document.

Lastly, Mistral was asked to write chapter *Release History* based on the json schema file.

```
Prompt: Write the Release History for the API described in the json file.
```

Mistral's answer includes several dates as provided in the json file, but does not match the benchmark document:

```
The API has undergone several iterations and updates to enhance its functionality, improve performance, and expand its capabilities. Below is a chronological overview of the key releases and the enhancements introduced in each version.

```

Again, this might be due to the benchmark details not being presented in the json file.
The dates however vaguely match those presented in the benchmark document.

#### Overall assessment

While Mistral exceeded in creating content for the Conformance document, it does not for the Userguide document.
Based on the above presented results, not enough detail seemed to be given by presenting the json file solely.
Putatively, Mistral might be capable of writing the chapters for the Userguide document if meta information is included in the json file.
Potentially, supplying additional documents like e.g. Use Case scenarios might enable Mistral to write those chapters with enough detail.
