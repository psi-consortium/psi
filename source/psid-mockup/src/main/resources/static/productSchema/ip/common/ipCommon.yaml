      Ethernet using the Ethernet Synchronous Messaging Channel (ESMC) protocol
      as defined in ITU-T G.8264/Y.1364 MUST be used on the corresponding
      physical link.

      - NO_ESMC - Synchronous Ethernet as defined in ITU-T G.8262/Y.1362 MUST be
      used on the corresponding physical link with synchronization provided by
      the Service Provider or Operator by the Subscriber. SSM for Synchronous
      Ethernet using the Ethernet Synchronous Messaging Channel (ESMC) protocol
      as defined in ITU-T G.8264/Y.1364 MUST NOT be used on the corresponding
      physical link.

    description: |
      Link Aggregation, as described in IEEE Std. 802.1AX-2020 allows one or
      more parallel instances of full-duplex point-to-point Ethernet links to be
      aggregated to form a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) such that the MAC Client
      (the UNI Access Link) can treat the LAG as if it were a single link.
